## Reading {#sec-wk13-reading}

The reading that accompanies the lectures this week is from [**chapter 10 of the core text by Howell (2017)**](https://onesearch.lancaster-university.uk/permalink/f/cssk39/44LAN_ALMA_DS51180136050001221).

## Pre-lab activities {#sec-wk13-prelab-activities}

After having watched the lectures and read the textbook chapter you'll be in a good position to try these activities. Completing them before you attend your lab session will help you to consolidate your learning and help move through the lab activities more smoothly.

### Pre-lab activity 1: Visualising the regression line

Have a look at [**this visualisation of the regression line**](https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/ols_estimation_by_min_sse/) by Ryan Safner.

In this shiny app, you see a randomly-generated set of data points (within specific parameters, to keep the graph scaled properly). You can choose a slope and intercept for the regression line by using the sliders. The graph also displays the residuals as dashed red lines. Moving the slope or the intercept too much causes the generated line to create much larger residuals. The shiny app also calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) and the standard error of the regression (SER), which calculates the average size of the error (the red numbers). These numbers reflect how well the regression line fits the data, but you don't need to worry about those for now.

In the app he uses the equation Y = aX + b in which b is the intercept and a is the slope.

This is slightly different from the equation you saw during the lecture. There we talked about Y = b0 + b1\*X + e. Same equation, just different letters. So b0 in the lecture is equivalent to b in the app and b1 in the lecture is equivalent to a in the app.

Pre-lab activity questions:

1.  Change the slider for the intercept. How does it change the regression line?
2.  Change the slider for the slope. How does it change the regression line?
3.  What happens to the residuals (the red dashed lines) when you change the slope and the intercept of the regression line?

### Pre-lab activity 2: Data visualisation - practice with `ggplot2()`

We've mostly been using the `ggplot2` package for visualising data. You can read a great overview of the `ggplot2` package [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org). It also links to a 'cheatsheet' that you can download as a .pdf document. Lots of useful info on there!

With regard to visualising relations between continuous variables, the `geom_point()` function in combination with the `geom_line()` function is important. Also remember that it always a good idea to make sure you've given you axes informative labels (using the `labs()` function). You've used these functions before, but the following 'recipes' summarise what each one does and how to use it.

> **TASK** Have a look at each 'recipe' and read through it. Try to understand each step.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Recipes - how to use them
Each 'recipe' has the same structure.

1. First, it summarises what it is that you want to achieve when using that specific function. *In the case of `select()` it says "You want to extract specific columns from a data frame and return them as a new, smaller data frame."*
2. Then, it outlines a number of steps that you need to carry out when using this function. *For `select()` it outlines 2 steps: 1. Pass the dataframe to the function. 2. List the column(s) to return.*
3. Finally, there is an example talks you through using the function with some data. *For `select()` it uses an example with data on the weather.*
4. Additional information appears in extra boxes with a light-bulb icon. If you find those confusing, don't worry about them at this stage.

:::

* `geom_point()` - create a scatterplot - [**recipe**](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes/visualize/VisualizeA3)
* `geom_line()` - add a regression line - there is no recipe, but have a look at the `ggplot2()` [**cheatsheet**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) mentioned earlier
* `labs()` - change the axes labels - [**recipe**](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes/visualize/VisualizeG)

### Pre-lab activity 3: Getting ready for the lab class

#### Get your files ready

Download the [122_week13_forStudents.zip](data/week13/122_week13_forStudents.zip) file and upload it into the new folder in RStudio Server you created (see last week's Pre-lab activity 4 for instructions on how to do that.

::: {.callout-important}
## If you have difficulty uploading files to the server
If you get error messages when attempting to upload a file or a folder with files to the server, you can try the following steps:

* Close the R Studio server, close your browser and start afresh.
* Open the R Studio server in a **different** browser.
* Follow a work around where you use code to directly download the file to the server. The code to do that will be available at the start of the lab activity where you need that particular file. The code to download the file you need to complete the quiz is below.
:::

## Lab activities {#sec-wk13-lab-activities}

In this lab, you'll gain understanding of and practice with:

-   conducting simple regression in R
-   interpreting simple regression in R
-   reporting the results in APA format
-   when and why to apply simple regression to answer questions in psychological science

### Lab activity 1: The regression line

#### Question 1

What is the regression equation as discussed during the lecture and what does each letter represent?

#### Question 2

What are residuals?

#### Question 3

Discuss the answers to the pre-lab activity questions. What did you find?

a)  Change the slider for the intercept. How does it change the regression line? The value for y at x = 0 changes.

b)  Change the slider for the slope. How does it change the regression line? The steepness of the line changes.

c)  What happens to the residuals (the red dashed lines) when you change the slope and the intercept of the regression line? The distance between the fitted values (the line) and the observed values (the dots) increases. Therefore, the red dashed lines become longer suggesting that the residuals increase. The model therefore fits the data less well.

### Lab activity 2: Statistics anxiety and engagement in module activities

In this lab, we'll be working with real data and using regression to explore the question of whether there is a relationship between statistics anxiety and engagement in course activities.

#### Background

The hypothesis is that students who are more anxious about statistics are less likely to engage in course-related activities. This avoidance behaviour could ultimately be responsible for lower performance for these students (although we won't be examining the assessment scores in this activity).

We are going to analyse data from the STARS Statistics Anxiety Survey, which was administered to students in the third-year statistics course in Psychology at the University of Glasgow. All the responses have been anonymised by associating the responses for each student with an arbitrary ID number (integer).

The STARS survey (Cruise, Cash, & Bolton, 1985) is a 51-item questionnaire, with each response on a 1 to 5 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater anxiety.

Cruise, R. J., Cash, R. W., & Bolton, D. L. (1985). Development and validation of an instrument to measure statistical anxiety. *Proceedings of the American Statistical Association, Section on Statistical Education*, Las Vegas, NV.

**Example items from the STARS survey**

![](images/wk3/starsExample.png)

As a measure of engagement in the course, we will use data from Moodle usage analytics. Over the course of the term, there were eight optional weekly on-line sessions that students could attend for extra support. The variable `n_weeks` in the `psess.csv` file tells you how many (out of eight) a given student attended.

Our hypothesis was that greater anxiety would be reflected in lower engagement. Answer the following question.

>*Question 1a:* If our hypothesis is correct, what type of correlation (if any) should we observe between students' mean anxiety levels and the variable `n_weeks`?

::: {.callout-warning} 
## Before we begin
Let's put the basics in place:

* Make sure you have started a new R Markdown script. If you need a reminder of how to do that, please revisit week 6 of PSYC121 ([here](https://lu-psy-r.github.io/statistics_for_psychologists/PSYC121/Week6.html#some-basic-rmarkdown)).
* You'll need the data files `stars2.csv` and `psess.csv` you downloaded when completing Pre-lab activity 3. If you experienced issues with uploading files to the server, follow the instructions below.
* When starting a new analysis, it is a good idea to empty the R environment. This prevents objects and variables from previous analyses interfering with the current one. 
* Finally, make sure your working directory is set to the folder in which you have stored the data files (`stars2.csv` and `psess.csv`). 
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## If you couldn't upload files to the server, do this:
If you experienced difficulties with uploading a folder or a file to the server, you can use the code below to directly download the file you need in this lab activity to the server (instead of first downloading it to you computer and then uploading it to the server). Remember that you can copy the code to your clipboard by clicking on the 'clipboard' in the top right corner.
:::

```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://github.com/lu-psy-r/statistics_for_psychologists/blob/main/PSYC122/data/week13/stars2.csv?raw=true", destfile = "stars2.csv")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file("https://github.com/lu-psy-r/statistics_for_psychologists/blob/main/PSYC122/data/week13/psess.csv?raw=true", destfile = "psess.csv")
```

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Cleaning the R environment
You can clean the R environment by clicking on the broom icon at the top right of the environment window, or you can use the code below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
```
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Checking your working directory
Use the code below to check what you working directory is currently set to. This is the folder that R will use to look for files. Is the file path that is written to the Console after you run the code snippet the one that contains the data file? You can check by nativating to the path you can see in the Console in the 'Files' pane on the right. Does it contain the data files?

```{r eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

If your working directory is not set to the folder that contains the data file, navigate to folder that contains the data file in the 'Files' pane, click 'More' and then on 'Set as working directory'.
:::

>**Step 1.**  Add the code to load the relevant libraries in a new code chunk. We need the following ones: `broom`, `car` and `tidyverse`. If you are unsure, you can look at the 'Hint' below for a clue by expanding it. After that, if you are still unsure, you can view the code by expanding the 'Code' section below. 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
Use the `library()`function. Remember to put it inside a 'code chunk' in your R Markdown script.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code
The code to do this is below. 
```
library(broom)
library(car)
library(tidyverse)
```
:::

>**Step 2.**  Read in both files, have a look at the layout of the data and familiarise yourself with it.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
Use the `read_csv()`function to read in the data and the `head()` function to have a quick look at each data frame.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code
The code to do this is below. 
```
stars <- read_csv("stars2.csv")
engage <- read_csv("psess.csv")

head(stars) # Look at the data frames
head(engage)
```
:::

>*Question 2a:* In the `stars` data frame, what do the numbers in the first row across the three columns refer to?

>**Step 3.**    Getting the data ready. Now that we've read in both data files, the next step is to calculate the mean anxiety scores for each participant. At the moment we have scores on all questions separately for each participant in the `stars` table. Instead we need one mean anxiety score for each participant. Write the code to calculate mean anxiety scores. 

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
Remember that participant is identified by the `ID` variable. Use `group_by()` and `summarise()`. Store the resulting table in a variable named `stars_mean`.  Also, remember to use `na.rm = TRUE` when calculating the mean scores to deal with participants who have missing data (NAs).
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code
The code to do this is below:
```
stars_means <- stars %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  summarise(mean_anxiety = mean(Score, na.rm = TRUE))
```
:::

>*Question 3a:* What is the mean anxiety score for participant 3?

Ok, before we get ahead of ourselves, in order to perform the regression analysis we need to combine the data from `stars` (the mean anxiety scores) with the data from `engage` (n_weeks).

> **TASK**: Join the two tables, call the resulting table `joined`.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
Use the `inner_join()` function (making use of the variable that is common across both tables) to join.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code
The code to do this is below:
```
joined <- inner_join(stars_means, engage, "ID")
```
:::

> **Step 4.** We now need descriptive statistics for both variables. Calculate the mean and standard deviations for the anxiety scores and the engagement data.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
Use the `summarise()` function, in combination with the `mean()` and `sd()` functions to do this. Remember to use `na.rm = TRUE` when calculating the mean scores to deal with participants who have missing data (NAs).
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code
The code to do this is below:
```
descriptives <- joined %>%
  summarise(mean_anx = mean(mean_anxiety, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_anx = sd(mean_anxiety, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_weeks = mean(n_weeks, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weeks = sd(n_weeks, na.rm = TRUE))
```
:::

>*Question 4a:* What are the means and standard deviation for anxiety and engagement with the statistics module?

>**Step 5.** Visualise the data. As always, it is a good idea to visualise your data. Now that we have all the variables in one place, make a scatterplot of anxiety as a function of engagement.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
For this you'll need the `ggplot() function together with `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()`. Make sure to give your axes some sensible labels with the `labs()` function.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code
The code to do this is below:
```
ggplot(joined, aes(x = mean_anxiety, y = n_weeks)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Anxiety", y = "Engagement") +
  theme_bw()
```
:::


>*Question 5a:* What does the scatterplot suggest about the relationship between anxiety and engagement?

> **Step 6.** With all the variables in place, we're ready now to start building the regression model. Use the `lm()` function to run the regression model in which you model engagement (the outcome variable) as a function of anxiety (the predictor variable) and use the `summary()` function to look at the output.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
Use the template below. Replace the 'outcome', 'predictor' and 'my_data' parts with the relevant info.
```
mod <-lm(outcome ~ predictor, data = my_data)
mod_summary <- summary(mod)
mod_summary
```
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code
The code to do this is below:
```
mod <- lm(n_weeks ~ mean_anxiety, data = joined)
mod_summary <- summary(mod)
mod_summary
```
:::

>*Question 6a:* What is the estimate of the y-intercept for the model, rounded to three decimal places?

>*Question 6b:* To three decimal places, if the General Linear Model for this model is `Y=beta0 + beta1X + e`, then the value of `beta1` is ...

>*Question 6c:* To three decimal places, for each unit increase in anxiety, engagement decreases by ...

>*Question 6d:* To two decimal places, what is the overall F-value of the model?

>*Question 6e:* Is the overall model significant?

>*Question 6f:* What proportion of the variance does the model explain?

> **Step 7.** Now that we've fitted a model, let's check whether the model meets the assumptions of linearity, normality and homoscedasticity. Write the code to create the plots that allow you to check the assumptions.

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
`crPlots()` to check linearity, `qqPlot()` to check normality of the residuals, and `residualPlot()` to check homoscedasticity of the residuals.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Code
The code to do this is below
```
crPlots(mod)            # Plot linear line and line that best fits the data to check the relationship between outcome and predictor is linear

qqPlot(mod$residuals)   # Create qq-plot to check residuals are normally distributed

residualPlot(mod)      # Create residual plot to check residual show homoscedasticity
```
:::

>*Question 7a:* Does the relationship appear to be linear?

>*Question 7b:* Do the residuals show normality?

>*Question 7c:* Do the residuals show homoscedasticity?

> **Step 8.** Finally, it's time to write up the results following APA guidelines. What would the results section look like if you wrote them up, following APA guidelines?

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
The [**Purdue writing lab website**](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/apa_numbers_statistics.html) is helpful for guidance on punctuating statistics.

## Answers {#sec-wk13-answers}

When you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. **Remember**, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. **Actively engaging** with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else's completed code...

<!-- The answers to the questions and the script containing the code will be available after the final lab session has taken place. -->

### Lab activity 1

1.  What is the regression equation as discussed during the lecture and what does each letter represent?

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**Y = b0 + b1 \* X + e** **Y = outcome variable** **b0 = intercept** **b1 = slope** **X = predictor variable** **e = error**
:::

2.  What are residuals?

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**Residuals reflect the discrepancy between the observed values and the fitted values and give an indication of how well the model 'fits' the data.**
:::

3.  Discuss the answers to the pre-lab activity questions. What did you find?

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
a)  Change the slider for the intercept. How does it change the regression line? **The value for y at x = 0 changes.**
b)  Change the slider for the slope. How does it change the regression line? **The steepness of the line changes.**
c)  What happens to the residuals (the red dashed lines) when you change the slope and the intercept of the regression line? **The distance between the fitted values (the line) and the observed values (the dots) increases. Therefore, the red dashed lines become longer suggesting that the residuals increase. The model therefore fits the data less well.**
