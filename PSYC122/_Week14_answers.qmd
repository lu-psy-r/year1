## Answers {#sec-wk14-answers}

When you have completed all of the lab content, you may want to check your answers with our completed version of the script for this week. **Remember**, looking at this script (studying/revising it) does not replace the process of working through the lab activities, trying them out for yourself, getting stuck, asking questions, finding solutions, adding your own comments, etc. **Actively engaging** with the material is the way to learn these analysis skills, not by looking at someone else's completed code...

The answers to the questions and the script containing the code will be available after the final lab session has taken place.

### Lab activity 1

1.  How does Pearson's Chi-square differ from Pearson's correlation?

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**Pearson's Chi-square assesses whether there is a relationship between categorical (or nominal) variables. Pearson's correlation assesses whether there is a relationship between continuous (or interval/ratio) variables.**

2.  Chi-square test of independence would be appropriate when testing the following questions:

a.  What is the relationship between gender and soft drink preference?

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**True**
:::

b.  How do males and females compare in terms of wanting to be a psychologist when they leave school?

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**True**

3.  Write the chi-square formula below.

    a.  Complete the Pearson's chi-square test by hand using the data above and fill in the blanks:

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
![](images/wk4/chisquare_dataLabAct1_answer.png)

**First determine expected frequencies:** **Smoke/drink: (70 x 65) / 110 = 41.36** **Smoke/don't drink (70 x 45) / 110 = 28.63** **Don't smoke/drink (40 x 65) / 110 = 23.63** **Don't smoke/don't drink (40 x 45) / 110 = 16.36**

**Then calculate chi-square:** **Smoke/drink: (50-41.36)2 / 41.36 = 1.80** **Smoke/don't drink: (20-28.63)2 / 28.63 = 2.60** **Don't smoke/drink: (15-23.63)2 / 23.63 = 3.15** **Don't smoke/don't drink: (25-16.36)2 / 16.36 = 4.56** **1.80+2.60+3.15+4.56 = 12.11**

$\chi 2$ (1, *N* = 110) = 12.11, *p* \< .001

Can you reject the null hypothesis? **Yes**
:::

5.  Why is it recommended to opt for multiple 2 x 2 chi-squares instead of chi-squares larger than 2 x 2?

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**It is easier to interpret and such a design requires a smaller sample size.**
:::

6.  How could you 'modify' the contingency table below for chi-square analysis to aid subsequent interpretation of the data/results?

::: {.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
![](images/wk4/122_week14_labAc1_q6.png)

**By combining 'interested' and 'somewhat interested' or by partitioning (doing multiple 2 x 2 chi-squares, while using Bonferroni correction to account for running multiple tests**

### Lab activity 2

>*Question 2a:* What do the numbers in the first row across the four columns refer to?

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**condition = 1, intend = 1, actualdonate = 1 and id = 1 shows us that participant 1 was in the 'reminder-through-assocation' condition, reported that they intended to donate and also actually donated.**
:::

>*Question 3a:* How many participants were removed because they didn't intend to return the paper-clips?

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**10 participants. The table 'intent_data' contains 87 observations, after we have applied the `filter()` function to include only those participants who did intend to return the paper-clips, the intent_recode table contains 77 observations.**
:::

>*Question 4a:* How many participants in the control condition didn’t donate?

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**22**
:::

>*Question 4b:* How many participants in the control condition donated?

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**16**
:::

>*Question 4c:* How many participants in the rta condition didn’t donate?

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**10**
:::

>*Question 4d:*  How many participants in the rta condition donated?

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**29**
:::

>*Question 5a:* What does `position = "dodge"` do?

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**"dodge" places the bars next to each other, rather than on top of each other.**
:::

>*Question 6a:* What do you conclude from the output?

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**There is a significnat association between the grouping variables.**
:::

>*Question 7a:* What do you conclude from the output?

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**The expected frequencies in all cells are greater than 5.**
:::

>*Question 8a:* How large is the effect and how much variance is accounted for?

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**The effect size (Cramer's V) = 0.33 and the percentage variance accounted for = 11%.**
:::

>*Question 9a:* What do you conclude from the output?

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**The standardised residuals in the 4 cells are all of a roughly similar size (and below 1.96), which suggests that the statistically significant Chi-square tests is not driven by one or two cells, but reflects the pattern across all cells.**
:::

>*Write up:*

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
## Answer
**Those in the reminder-through-association condition performed the intended behaviour at a significantly higher rate (74%, 29 out of 39) than did those in the control condition (42%, 16 out of 38)), *χ2*(1, N = 77) = 8.24, *p* = 0.004, *V* = 0.33. The analysis showed that 11% of variance in intended behaviour could be accounted for by condition (reminder-through-association vs. control).**
