Some of the text for the activities is still being updated (due to a very busy schedule this week!!!). Please bear with me - I will update to the final version over the weekend…\nTom",

    "text": "3.1 - Customisation of data plots\nStep 1. Set up a folder for Week 4 and set the working directory.\nStep 2. Bring the week_4_2025.zip file into R Studio server. Like last week, upload the zip file. Launch the week_4 R script.\nIf you’ve done Step 1 & 2 already as a lab preparation, super! Pat yourself on the back, skip these steps, and move on…\nStep 3. Once again, we’re gong to be using several commands from the tidyverse library (the pipe operator is one example) so we need to ensure that it’s active. Run the command\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nStep 4. Read in the “wages.csv” data. There’s already a read_csv() script line for this, you just need to change the file name (like we’ve done in previous weeks).\nStep 5. Customize you graph work. We’ve provided some suggestions about adding titles and labels for your graph. Edit and play with the script lines to make them useful to you and to understand how they work. Note that the ggplot instructions have a similar structure / grammar to the group_by() instructions that we used: piping a data frame to a (here, plotting) function and piping that to an output or summarisation format.\n\nTry change the text, the colours, and so on of the graphs.\nAdd comments for yourself about what the different commands do. The idea is to learn by trying different things out (changing values, taking out elements of the command, putting other is) and record for yourself.\nIf you are struggling or not sure, try look at help files.",

    "text": "4.2 - z-scores\n\nHint / Reminder: Sketch a normal (z score) distribution and mark the mean/mode, and mark off the relevant parts of the question so you know what you are trying to achieve and how to interpret any calculations you make.\n\n\nHint/ Guide 2. For questions 6 & 7, typically in psychology we use the 5% level as a cutoff to decide, in broadly described terms, whether something is extreme or unlikely vs. at least somewhat plausible or likely.\n\n\n4.2.1 z-scores 1\nz-score distributions\nQ1. What is the relationship between the sign of a z-score and its position in a distribution?\nQ2. If a distribution has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10, what is the raw score equivalent to a z-score of 1.96?\nQ3. If a distribution has a mean of 157 and a standard deviation of 19, what is the raw score equivalent to a z-score of 1?\n\n\n3.2.2 Using z-score tables\nQ4. What proportion of scores lie between the mean and a z-score of 0.5?\nQ5. What is the combined proportion of scores lying between z=-1.2 and z=.85?\n\n\n3.2.3 z-scores 3 Applying z-scores to inferential problems\nQ6. A Neuropsychologist has presented a test of face recognition to 200 neurotypical participants and finds that the scores are normally distributed with a mean of 85 and the standard deviation of 12. Two brain-damaged patients are also given the test. The one with right hemisphere brain damage scored 58 and the one with left hemisphere damage scored 67.\n\nWhat is the z score of the right hemisphere patient when compared to the neurotypical group?\nWhat proportion of neurotypical participants score lower than this patient?\nIs this patient likely to belong to the population of neurotypical participants? (justify your answer)\nWhat is the z score of the left hemisphere patient when compared to the neurotypical group?\nWhat proportion of neurotypical participants score lower than this patient?\nIs this patient likely to belong to the population of neurotypical participants? (justify your answer)\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Final z-score challenge\nCome back to this afterwards for some extra practice if you want:\nQ7. Tom Bunion has completed a huge research study and measured the foot size of men and women and found each to be normally distributed. The men have a mean size of 55 with a standard deviation of 5 and the women a mean of 33 and a standard deviation of 5. Joanna Toes has foolishly measured two individuals but forgotten to note their gender. These have foot sizes of 37 and 47. To which gender is each more likely to belong? What evidence is there for this?",
